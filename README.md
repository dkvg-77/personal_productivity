# Productive website for personal use.
A website that I created for myself that can be used in my daily use. I created this project as a medium to learn React and also upload my various small project that I did during my learning process into a big project.

## Important features: 
--> A random background image, random quote, and shows time and date on the home page.
--> Todo list and bookmark list.
--> Weather Report of the city you search.
--> My profile in the About section. 

## Technology used: 
--> React 

## The process to run the program:
--> Download using zip and extract the folder.
--> Enter npm install and install all the packages necessary.
--> Enter npm start in the terminal.
--> Now, you are ready to use the website in your Chrome.

## Other details:
--> Have used API to generate random quotes and background images on the home page. 
--> It also shows the current time.
--> There is a to-do list where you can keep check on all your todos. You can delete them when you are done.
--> Bookmark list to save important bookmarks. You can delete also.
--> Both the todos list and bookmark list are saved in your local host. So, there is no need to worry about it.
